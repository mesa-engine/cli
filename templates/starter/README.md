# ECS Roguelike Starter

rot.js, and Typescript.

### Build and run
I've intentionally left out a bundler so developers can choose their preferred.
To quickly get it up and running run the following two commands from the root of the project.

- npm install --global parcel-bundler
- parcel src/index.html

Then navigate to http://localhost:1234

Parcel will watch for changes to the code and automatically build it and refresh the page.
